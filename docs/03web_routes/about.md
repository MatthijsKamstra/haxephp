# About Webapi 2

The second example in the webapi series!
This time we will us `php.Web.getParams();` to change the output.
It will come close to a website, but without the styling.

The next chapter will focus on that part.

This will use the `php.Lib.print` (or `neko.Lib.print`) function that prints some raw string (without adding debug information). It will print the parameters sent by the browser.

There is also a lot of useful functionality available in the Web class.
Read up on that here: [http://api.haxe.org/php/Web.html](http://api.haxe.org/php/Web.html)

**Note that the `php` package tries to mimic as far as possible the `neko` one. This allows for easy switching between the two platforms**
