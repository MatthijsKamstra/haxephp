# Haxe and PHP

![Haxe logo](img/haxe_php_logos.png)

I use PHP target a lot, because the servers are cheap and my website is already running on PHP.

As most target with Haxe, they are poorly documented.
I hope this will help you. If you think so, why not help with [contribution](contribute.md) to this tutorial site.

### How will this help me?

It will get you started with PHP **and** Haxe.
How to setup your project, install externs and how to work with them. This probably will never be a complete documentation but it will help you get started!

### Who is this for?

For clever, cool and handsome developers. Duh! :D

* Probably for PHP developers who already started with Haxe.
* PHP developers who write more then a half a dozen classes.
* Flash-developers looking for an AS3 replacement
* Flash-developers starting with PHP
* Freelance developers working with PHP
* Small developers teams working on big projects


## Documentation goals

I wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.
That's why I use Markdown. Developers use it, but is just writing in plain English so **everybody** can write documentation!
And this documentation hosted on Github, developers favorite place to store code.
Even if you are not a developer. Don't want to clone everything, you still can change the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the `.md` files).
And as a final resort, you can leave your comments/suggestions/etc at the bottom of the page via Disqus.


## Open-sourcing the documentation

I thought I was the first to try to write documentation and open-sourcing it this way, but other beat me.
Although I was already writing everything with markdown, it looked like a good idea to use Gitbook to "publish" it. Writing documentation is like writing a book.

**Other clever developers who had this idea before me:**
