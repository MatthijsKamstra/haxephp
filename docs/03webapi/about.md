#About Webapi 3

Already the third example in the webapi series!

I try to build upon the previous webapi examples. If the [`example.md`](example.md) misses something, make sure to check out the previous webapi examples 

The previous example was kinda ugly (un-styled), in this example we will fix that.

We will be using [template](http://api.haxe.org/haxe/Template.html) to make that easier.
Read more about this subject <http://haxe.org/manual/std-template.html>

For styling we will use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/).
And the same html structure: [check example here](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template) 

The CSS (styling) will be via Bootstrap CDN.
