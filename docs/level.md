# Level of Difficulty

I thought it would be useful to have some idea what sort of level the examples have here.

How to define your level on a specific topic?

- **Beginner:** No knowledge at all of the topic
- **Basic:** A very basic knowledge of the topic but no professional usage
- **Intermediate:** A basic knowledge of the topic but no regular professional usage
- **Advanced:** A good knowledge of the topic and a regular professional usage
- **Expert:** A perfect knowledge of the topic and a daily professional usage

How does that translate to these examples?

## Beginner

**No knowledge at all of the topic.**
These examples start with the simplest code.
But I don't think you will have any use of these examples without knowledge of Haxe or PHP.
Start learning the basics of PHP and Haxe.
To get you start I have a little chapter about [learning Haxe](haxe/learn-haxe.md).

## Basic

**A very basic knowledge of the topic but no professional usage**

- [Example Hello World](00helloworld/about.md)
- [Example webapi 1](01web_querystring/about.md)
- [Example webapi 2](02webapi/about.md)

## Intermediate

**A basic knowledge of the topic but no regular professional usage**

- [Example webapi 3](03webapi/about.md)
- [Example NASA](06nasa/about.md)
- [Example Json](08json/about.md)

## Advanced

**A good knowledge of the topic and a regular professional usage**

- [Example webapi 4](04webapi/about.md)
- [Example forms](05forms/about.md)
- [Example flat file](09flatfile/about.md)
- [Example SQLite](10sqlite/about.md)

## Expert

**A perfect knowledge of the topic and a daily professional usage**

Go away, you're done.
