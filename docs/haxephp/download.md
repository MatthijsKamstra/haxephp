#Install Haxe

Before you can use there are a couple of thing you need to do.

Obviously you need to install Haxe. There are a [couple of ways to do it](../haxe/installation.md), but in this document I will send you to the [official place](#haxe).

And a [code editor](#ide) will be useful!

---

Current version is:

- **Haxe** v3.2.1

But if the version numbers changed, it means I haven't updated this part of the document in some time :D

##Code editor

If you work on Windows you should install [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org). On other platforms you should read this chapter: [Choosing a Code Editor](../haxe/choosing-a-code-editor.md).
