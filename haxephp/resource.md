## PHP?

PHP itself is beyond the scope of this resource - it is assumed that you already are familiar with it, and you are here to learn about the Haxe PHP target.

The following resources are worth checking out as a refresher:

* <http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/php/>
* <http://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp>

All you learn from these resources about PHP is appliable here!
