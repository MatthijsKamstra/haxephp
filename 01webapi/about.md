#About Webapi 1

You started with a [hello world](../00helloworld/about.md), that's an example you can use on all platforms.
It's from the [Haxe Generic API](http://api.haxe.org/), available for all platforms. Now let's look at the ServerSide specific API, which is located in the package [`php`](http://api.haxe.org/php/). 


This will use the `php.Lib.print` function that prints some raw string (without adding debug information). It will print the parameters sent by the browser.

There is also a lot of useful functionality available in the Web class.
Read up on that here: [http://api.haxe.org/php/Web.html](http://api.haxe.org/php/Web.html)


__Note that the `php` package tries to mimic as far as possible the `neko` one. This allows for easy switching between the two platforms__
